# RAILP
routing agnostic integer linear programming

The ILP mpdel and RAILP model used in the paper 'Topology design for GNSSs considering both inter-satellite links and ground-station links'
- LinkAmount_Ka is to verify the number of ranging links
- Delay_Ka_flow is to calculate the average delay of the obtained topology
